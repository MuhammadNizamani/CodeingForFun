# In Python, memoryview is a built-in object that allows you to
# access the internal buffer of an object that supports the buffer
# protocol. This includes objects such as bytes, bytearray, and numpy arrays.
# A memoryview object provides a way to access the data of an object as a memory
# buffer, without making a copy of the data. This can be useful when you want to
# manipulate large amounts of data without incurring the overhead of copying the
# data to a new object. Here's an example of how to use memoryview to
# access the buffer of a bytes object:


# Create a bytes object
data = b"hello world"

# Create a memoryview object from the bytes object
mv = memoryview(data)

# Access the buffer of the memoryview object
buffer = mv.tobytes()

# Modify the data in the buffer
buffer = buffer.replace(b"l", b"Z")

# Print the modified buffer
print(buffer)   # prints b'heZZo worZd'
